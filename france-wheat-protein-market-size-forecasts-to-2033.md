<h3><strong>What is Wheat Protein?</strong></h3>
<p>Wheat protein, also known as wheat gluten, is derived from wheat flour through a process that removes starch and other components, leaving behind a high-protein concentrate. It is widely used in the food industry for its functional properties, such as elasticity, water absorption, and binding capabilities. Wheat protein is a key ingredient in products like meat substitutes, baked goods, and nutritional supplements.</p>
