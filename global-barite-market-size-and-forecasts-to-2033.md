<h3><strong>What is Barite?</strong></h3>
<p>Barite, also known as baryte, is a naturally occurring mineral that is typically found in sedimentary rocks. It is most commonly white or colorless but can also appear in shades of blue, brown, or gray depending on impurities. Barite is primarily used as a weighting agent in drilling fluids for the oil and gas industry, accounting for a significant portion of its global demand. Additionally, it is used in the production of barium-based chemicals, radiation shielding, and as a filler in paints, plastics, and rubber.</p>
