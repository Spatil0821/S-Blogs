<h3><strong>What is Seed Treatment?</strong></h3>
<p>Seed treatment refers to the application of various materials to seeds to protect them from pathogens, pests, and environmental stressors. These materials can include:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>
<p><strong>Chemical Seed Treatments</strong>: Fungicides, insecticides, and nematicides are commonly used to protect seeds from soil-borne diseases and pests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Biological Seed Treatments</strong>: Beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, are applied to seeds to promote plant growth and suppress diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Seed Treatments</strong>: Techniques like seed coating and pelleting are used to improve seed handling and planting efficiency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Seed treatment not only enhances seed germination and early plant growth but also reduces the need for excessive pesticide use, making it an environmentally friendly solution.</p>
